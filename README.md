# Deforestation in supply chains

This piece is part of a Capstone Data Science project I am working on modelling deforestation rates associated with soymeal production in Brazil.

- Scraped deforestation and commodity price data from multiple sources.
- Used pandas for EDA, wrangling datasets of > 295K rows. 
- Engineered features to quantify and aggregate contributions from different regions and products.
- Created visualizations with matplotlib and Tableau.
- Optimized linear and random forest regressors using GridSearch CV to reach best models.
- Used Facebook Prophet time series analysis to predict soy meal prices.
